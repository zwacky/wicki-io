In remembrance of my first love.

Your LTS came finally to an end. You retired on 31st December 2021. You will always have a special place in my heart.
<br><br>

> You arrived with great anticipation,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the web dev world upside down;<br>
> Model, View and Controller were in separation,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Javascript beginners didn't frown.<br>
> 
> Be it JavaScript, CoffeeScript or SCSS,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You handled them all in a snap;<br>
> Grunt helped you to transpile and compress,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing needed was an `ng-app`.<br>
> 
> You were patient with faulty code,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing errors with the where and why;<br>
> Did selectors return a wrong DOM node?<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did watchers kill the CPU workload?<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did a variable on `$scope` get overshadowed?<br>
> Maybe the external callback needs an `$apply`!<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe `$inject` lacks used params to minify!<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe avoid `$rootScope` for all events passing by!<br>
> 
> You were either praised or attacked,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, you advanced and left doubters behind;<br>
> Daily flame wars you fought against react,<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the day `window.angular` became `undefined`.<br>
