- try reading several books at the same time. no energy for that heavy piece of interesting science book? maybe something lighter would work for a few minutes before going to sleep then?


- whenever I start the day with 10 pages of reading, i feel like i can keep up with my plan of reading a book. immediately I feel better

- have an array of books lined up already. optimally separate these 2 actions:
	- find books while browsing or actively searching
	- read books

it's überwältigend to think that you need to read 300 pages for one book.
what if you broke it down? only read 10 pages a day and you'll finish one book in 1 month. that will be 12 books in a year. much better deal than reading 0 books because one is overwhelmed of the amount of pages.
	- it's always good to break down a new book into 'sessions'

# settings for different book format consumption
- doing chores at home: audio book @ 1.3 speed (depends on book, some are narrated very slow even)
- walking outside / commuting: audio book @ 1x speed
- in the bed: book
- before starting the day in front of computer: book
