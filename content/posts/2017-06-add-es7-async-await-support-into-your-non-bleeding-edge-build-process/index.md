Async/Await has been around the block already some time. Now that it is in stage-4 since July 2016 ([stage finished](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/) in the ECMAScript proposals) and [nearly all evergreen browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=async-functions) support it natively, too (except IE is late to the party as usual ðŸ˜ª) â€” itâ€™s definitely time to take a second look.

## TL;DR I WANT ASYNC/AWAIT SUPPORT NAO!!1

- use [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env)
- **yarn add regenerator or npm install regenerator**
- add **node_modules/regenerator-runtime/runtime.js** (10.7kb minified) into your bundle

## #1 Requirements

### #1.1 Babel

Forget **preset-stage-0**, **babel-plugin-syntax-async-functions** or whatever you can still find on outdated resources. Just use [babel-preset-env](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env).

Your **.babelrc** could look like this for the bare minimum to work (add your fancy plugins and more if needed):

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "browsers": ["last 2 versions", "IE >= 9"]
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

If youâ€™re like me, then you canâ€™t just forget about Internet Explorer â‰¥ 9. babel-preset-env lets you specify a [browserlist config](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) that calculates your needs and then automatically takes care of all the needed babel plugins.

**Note:** The babel plugins do not bloat your bundle file. Polyfills do:

### #1.2 Polyfills

> An argument could be made for the transform to inject an import for **babel-regenerator-runtime** automatically, but generally Babel has shied away from automatically injecting imports since there is no guarantee that the user will be using a module system, so the global route was taken. ([from GitHub Issue December 2015](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/3825#issuecomment-245406852))

Babel has shied away of automagically adding polyfills for generators. Therefore you need to add your own polyfill. There is a [babel-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-polyfill) that adds all possible polyfills and has a proud size of 97kb minified. If you only need the generator polyfill â€” which is needed for async/await â€” then you can just use [facebook/regenerator](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator), which is used by babel-polyfill anyway.

- **yarn add regenerator** or **npm install regenerator --save** (no dev dependency because it will be injected into your frontend bundle)
- add **node_modules/regenerator-runtime/runtime.js** (10.7kb minified) into your bundle

Or donâ€™t use a polyfill at all.

If you have set your browser targeting to **chrome >= 39** then you simply will use the native generators and will never make use of the polyfill. But then again, youâ€™ll save 10kb minified here. Might be easier to add the polyfill and later on make the webapp available for IE9.

## #2 Linting (ESLint)

If youâ€™re still using ES6 to write JavaScript, then you probably came across [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). It also comes with a neat [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), that will read your .eslintrc.json correctly and lint accordingly.

You need to tell your .eslintrc.json config, that youâ€™re now playing with the big tools and tell it to lint for ECMAScript version 8:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "commonjs": true,
    "es6": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 8
  },
  "rules": {}
}
```
