[My first Product Hunt Launch](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notyfy-2) 🎉—a lot of time went into the preparation together with my friend [Peter](http://peterthaleikis.com/) 👋. Read on to see what **stats** and **learnings** finishing #11 on Product Hunt brings.

## Notyfy

Let me quickly run you through what the product is that I launched on Product Hunt:

[Notyfy](https://notyfy.co/) is a browser extension that aggregates web notifications from Twitter, Reddit, Facebook and many more in one place. It is able to see which of the supported platforms you are already logged in — without requiring sensitive credentials like passwords—and does the checking for new notifications for you. Super seamless. Give it a try!

## Stats

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-06-stats-and-learnings-from-finishing-11-on-product-hunt/notyfy-install-stats.png" alt="Notyfy install stats on Chrome Web Store platform" caption="Notyfy’s install stats on Chrome Web Store platform" >}}

* +218 Product Hunt upvotes
* +165 New Users (+151%)
* #11 Product of the Day
* 19.9% Install Conversion

Let’s quickly talk about the Install Conversion: It’s a calculation with the data I had available (I’m not using any tracking inside the extensions themselves). I was surprised that having something so frictionless and without sign ups could yield such a high conversion: 19,9%!

I used the following formula:

> **Conversion** = (Chrome Installs + Firefox Installs) / Landing Page Views
> 
> **19,9%** = (73 + 13) / 432

## Learnings

* **📢 Hunter’s followers aren’t notified:** After some testing we saw that none of the hunter’s followers were notified upon the new product launch. On the other hand the Maker’s followers were notified. Therefore best add the Hunter as the Maker as well, to get that initial upvote traffic from the Hunter’s followers as well.
* **👀 Catch the user’s attention:** It’s very crucial to have a catchy logo and an understandable tagline
* **📅 Set a launch date:** The preparation took a lot of time and the longer it took the less results came out of it. It took even so long that once a random user hunted Notyfy by themselves! No prepared texts, assets and logos were present at that time and the random launch didn’t exceed 10 upvotes. A friendly mail to Product Hunt solved this issue within 1 hour 🎉
* **🗣 Interact with comments:** Engage with every comment on the launch page by replying to comments upvoting other comments. It’s highly probable that this impacts the front page ranking algorithm, too.
* **🙅‍♀️ Don’t fear haters:** Launching on Product Hunt exposes what you’ve worked on and that can be scary. But these comments usually are well structured and should be taken as feedback to make an even better product!
