I love reading books—I joyfully devour 1-4 books a month! That wasn't always the case. If you saw my home just two years ago you wouldn't have found any books. Back then I read a few blog posts online and that was it. I never felt the need to read pieces of paper bundled together.

...Until I tried it. I first tried it with a book called Factfulness by Hans Rosling. It had nice graphs, was backed by studies and science, wasn't too long: It was ideal to get my feet wet. And I liked it! It conciously and subconsciously changed my way of thinking.

Maybe one or two of my recommendations will pique your interest! Make sure to [holler at me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zwacky) what your favourites are; I love hearing about your own book takeaways!

Without further ado let me show you my top 5 book recommendations of 2019:


## Mindset

This book easily left the biggest impact on me. Let me ask you this question: Do you think a professional piano player is playing that well because they are just born with talent and sticked with it? Or do you think it's because they invest hours of effort in trying to become better and improve themselves?

The first question above comes from a fixed mindset, whereas the second question refers to a growth mindset. Dr. Carol Dweck carefully explains these two mindsets in her book after 25 years of research in the field of psychology. You'll understand the advantages of having a growth mindset and what impact it could have on you—and even on your children.

If you plan only to read a single book this year, then make it this one.

## Bad Blood

This book reads itself like a Hollywood Deception Drama—only that it is real! Prepare yourself for an amazing investigative work by John Carreyrou telling you the story how a Silicon Valley Startup got to the point of an $9 billion evaluation. The only catch? Their product did not work at all.

You may have heard of Theranos, the company led by turtle-neck-lover Elizabeth Holmes. They promised that their device could immediately do an array of health diagnostics with only a drop of blood taken from the fingertip. In this page turner you will see how far the executives went with their lies and law suits for their cover up.

## Nonviolent Communication

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-09-my-top-5-books-in-2019/cover-nonviolent-communication.png" alt="Nonviolent Communication Book" >}}

This book opened my eyes to something I knew existed but I never really followed up upon: Empathy. Have you ever heard the sentence "He just doesn't understand me"? Everybody wants to be heard. But do you know how to listen empathically? 

There is something satisfying behind the way Marshall B. Rosenberg explains how he gets called in to resolve different issues using the nonviolent communication approach. In one case described the conflict between a staff and their principal of a school. Another case describes what a married couple goes through and how they cleared it up. First the examples look hard to solve but then he unties all the knots.

I must admit that I'm not 100% on board with how he approaches _all and every_ communication issues. Some steps he's written about feel a bit hippie-y to me. But nontheless the quintessence of this book is very valuable.

## Atomic Habits

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-09-my-top-5-books-in-2019/cover-atomic-habits.png" alt="Why We Sleep Book" >}}

There exists a plethora of self-help books about productivity and habits, and more are still getting written. James Clear is one of the few productivity authors that made it big with this great framework of building good habits and breaking bad ones. It's even so well known that it's also the one book my friends and I have the most in common.

The two key takeaways are making small changes that will have a big impact over time and packing habits into routines. Imagine you practice a new skill like drawing every day when you wake up and had your coffee (routine) for only five minutes (small changes). Then compare your doodles of when you started with the drawings of one month later. Even if you became only 1% better at it every single day, that 1% is going to add up bigly.

## Why We Sleep

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-09-my-top-5-books-in-2019/cover-why-we-sleep.png" alt="Why We Sleepü Book" >}}

This book gave me figuratively a wake up call. I used to sleep only as much as I thought I could get through the day without my body showing signals of sleep deprivation.

Matthew Walker, the director of UC Berkley's Center for Human Sleep Science, writes about the results of his studies he conducted of participants with eight, six or even less hours of sleep daily. The conclusion is that we pay the price in many areas if we neglect sleep: Creativity, problem solving, decision-making, learning, memory, heart health, brain health, mental health, emotional well-being, immune system, and even your life span.

## Final words

I hope you enjoyed my little list of recommendations of books that I read in 2019. Have you read a book in common? Do you plan on picking one up?
