      <description>Create accurate Core Web Vitals reports with metric graphs and break downs by current daily measurements.
  Have you ever optimised your website for the Core Web Vitals (CWV)? Did you want to check your changes the next dayâ€”but Google&amp;rsquo;s various tools don&amp;rsquo;t give you current daily CWV metrics due to the rolling 28-day window?
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll review Google&amp;rsquo;s toolset for measuring CWV and explain an with Google Analytics (GA) to see if your changes had any effect on CWV by the day.</description>

      <title>How List Rendering Can Cause Huge Cumulative Layout Shift</title>
      <link>https://wicki.io/posts/2021-07-list-rendering-cls/</link>

      <guid>https://wicki.io/posts/2021-07-list-rendering-cls/</guid>
      <description>JS frameworks like Vue can give elements a unique key. In a list rendering they might be able to reuse these keyed list items, when the list is changing. The already created DOM nodes don&amp;rsquo;t need to be recreated. This is a great performance gain. But when a list changes and the nodes merely switch their position, the keyed items can be considered as a shift in the DOM (CLS) by Core Web Vitals on slow connection devices.</description>

      <description>Passing your Core Web Vitals and google will reward you with visibility.
  With Google&amp;rsquo;s June 2021 update Core Web Vitals (CWV) will become a factor in SEO ranking. It measures the quality of a site by these three metrics: LCP, FID and CLS.
If you pass all of them them, Google will reward you with more visibility.
You can check how well you do on these metrics via several ways:</description>

      <description>Keep the books you read in sync with your GitHub profile README
  In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you how to use GitHub Actions to automatically sync your Goodreads books you read in your GitHub profile README.
I created goodreads-profile-workflow for devs that love to read and like to share what they read. You can customise the input parameters to your liking: list the books you&amp;rsquo;re currently reading, last 5 books you read and even add your personal ratings, too.</description>

      <title>Useful Npx Packages for the Developer&#39;s Everyday Life</title>

      <description>Npm comes with a neat tool called npx that lets you directly execute packages from the npm registry. It temporarily downloads it behind the scene and won&amp;rsquo;t pollute your local or global npm environment.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll skip useful packages that are bound to libraries and frameworks like Angular&amp;rsquo;s ng, react&amp;rsquo;s create-react-app or capacitor&amp;rsquo;s cap.
I focus on packages that have helped me through my daily life as a developer.</description>

      <title>Time to Say Goodbye to Google Fonts</title>
      <link>https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/</link>

      <guid>https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Google Fonts in prototypes and in 10M+ MAU products. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly easy to get started with and provides an amazing font discovery. That&amp;rsquo;s also why it&amp;rsquo;s currently still used on over 42M websites!
This convenience has its price: Performance. Many have already pointed out the cost of multiple requests. If you want the remaining speed boost, then you&amp;rsquo;re best off downloading your used Google Fonts and self-host them.</description>

      <description>I love reading booksâ€”I read through 1-4 books a month. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t always the case. If you saw my home just two years ago you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have found any books. Back then I read a few blog posts online and that was it. I never felt the need to read pieces of paper bundled together.
&amp;hellip;Until I tried it. I first tried it with a book called Factfulness by Hans Rosling.</description>

      <description>â€¦and other things Iâ€™ve heard regarding Hybrid App development.
Letâ€™s talk about the elephant in the room: Performance. Let me just show you how fast and smooth Hybrid apps can be based on this footage of my last work: JustWatch, a streaming search engine with 12M monthly active users. Itâ€™s been recorded on a OnePlus 6 (May 2018).
  &amp;ldquo;Hybrid Apps will never be faster than native&amp;rdquo; Yes, this is true.</description>

      <description>MARCH 2020 UPDATE: The new Firebase JS SDK Alpha makes your bundle up to 80% smaller! It now fully adopts tree-shaking and lets you import only what you truly need.
 In a lot of tutorials I came across the comfortable solution of just adding import * as firebase from &amp;lsquo;firebase&amp;rsquo; for your firebase import. As it turns out, there are 4 modular packages for Firebase. Here they are along with their sizes:</description>

      <description>Nearly all evergreen browsers support Async/Await natively
  Async/Await has been around the block already some time. Now that it is in stage-4 since July 2016 (stage finished in the ECMAScript proposals) and nearly all evergreen browsers support it natively, too (except IE is late to the party as usual ðŸ˜ª) â€” itâ€™s definitely time to take a second look.
TL;DR I WANT ASYNC/AWAIT SUPPORT NAO!!1  use babel-preset-env yarn add regenerator or npm install regenerator add node_modules/regenerator-runtime/runtime.</description>

      <description>New Update available popup.
  PWAs are getting more and more coverage and support. They improve the web experience and can load your app instantly with their great ability for HTTP caching (among other things, but this post only covers caching).
The thing with Offline-First is, that you cache all the resources that are needed for launching up the webapp â€” even your index.html!
 Note: No sweat!</description>

      <description>Demo https://jsbin.com/gutahovufe/1/edit?html,js,output
Explanation Sometimes you need to execute code after your list has been rendered on the client side.
// js angular.module(&amp;#39;ngRepeatDemo&amp;#39;, []) .controller(&amp;#39;AppCtrl&amp;#39;, function() { var vm = this; vm.alphabet = [ &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;e&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;f&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;g&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;h&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;j&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;k&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;l&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;m&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;n&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;o&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;p&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;q&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;s&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;t&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;u&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;v&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;w&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;x&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;y&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;z&amp;#39; ]; vm.finished = function() { alert(&amp;#39;fired&amp;#39;); // now javascript execution has been stopped and you should see all DOM nodes been created  // note: interpolation may not have been done completely  }; }); &amp;lt;!</description>

      <description>For external redirection
The use case here is to redirect the user to another domain. I havenâ€™t come across Redirect::away() before, even though itâ€™s been added in Laravel 4.0.8.
Redirect::to()   Redirect::away()   Difference Redirect::to() does additional URL checks and generations. Those additional steps are done in Illuminate\Routing\UrlGenerator and do the following, if the passed URL is not a fully valid URL (even with protocol):

      <description>$_ â€” last output maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to store results in a variable for quick calculations and just want to chain those computations.
  $0 â€” currently inspected element useful if you want to output or alter the selected element.
  angular.element($0).scope() â€” get AngularJS&amp;rsquo;s scope combined with $(0) this makes a great use to inspect a specific element and then check what it&amp;rsquo;s scope looks like.</description>

      <title>Laravel&#39;s URL::to() vs URL::asset()</title>
      <link>https://wicki.io/posts/2014-04-laravels-url-to-vs-url-asset/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wicki.io/posts/2014-04-laravels-url-to-vs-url-asset/</guid>
      <description>Short answer: No, not really.
You want to have the following code:
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;js/bootstrap.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; Now you can achieve this using blade syntax:
// using URL::to() &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;{{ URL::to(&amp;#39;js/bootstrap.js&amp;#39;) }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; // using URL::asset() &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;{{ URL::asset(&amp;#39;js/bootstrap.js&amp;#39;) }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; URL::to() The method is implemented like this:
  URL::asset() The method is implemented like this:
  Difference Both methods get the job done.
 URL::to() additionally encodes the segments of the passed url with rawurlencode URL::asset() removes index.</description>

      <description>Every dev at some point has made decisions how his backend API should look like. If youâ€™re coming from the web, then mostly for ajax calls. But what if that API should also address calls from other sources and clients.
To fill that gap i was watching an informative talk by Les Hazlewood about beautiful RESTful. Iâ€™ll cut this in several sections. This is merely an overview, the full coverage you can get from the youtube talk or the slides.</description>
